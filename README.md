# Observing Ocean Wave Conditions Capstone Project

This is a capstone project for Oregon State University. The project involves 2 implementations of various calculations preformed on acceleration data from ocean waves. We have an implementation in Python for on shore calculations and an implementation in C that will be loaded onto an AUV glider module.
